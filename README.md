# Immerse_Game
The goal is for the user to fit one circle inside another and to reveal a word to be read allowed. Use the up and down arrows to grow and shrink the size of the circle and left and right arrows to move the circle.

WIP
1. End Round and replace old words with new words (Bring circles back and have them glide to proper order by id.)
2. Prevent Target Bubble (TB) from overlapping
3. Fluid movement of Master Bubble (MB)
4. Refactor and modulate
